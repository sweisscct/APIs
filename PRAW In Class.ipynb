I shouldn't have to read your write up multiple times to try to figure out what point your trying to make.\n",

      "The other big thing that I notice, is some people have kind of lived in a suburban bubble and they have a difficult time communicating with many people. For example, I told a colleague she should talk to one of our other colleagues about a certain topic because he's smart and really knows a lot. She told me that she would love to, but literally cannot understand what he's saying. He has an accent, but I understand this man perfectly fine. Definitely not even close to being some of the more difficult accents I've heard. Basically, don't isolate yourself in a bubble. It will hinder your development in more ways than you could imagine.

I learned to communicate with more kindness, deescalate, coordinate with others under time pressure, and experienced forgetting about myself because my attention was focused so much on what others need that there was no GPU left for worrying what they think about me and how I come across. My social anxiety was never as bad as some people's but this experience pretty much cured it.\n",

      "\\- I joined 2 clubs and challenged myself to be the person who reaches out to potential external sponsors or guest speakers for these clubs.
